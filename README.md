# Sequence room transitions
A simple forty line script that allows you to call a single function to trigger an out (and in) transition from one room to the next, including from a room to itself (identical to a room_restart() call). Any sequence can be set up as an "in" or an "out" transition by calling the appropriate "moment" function at its end.
